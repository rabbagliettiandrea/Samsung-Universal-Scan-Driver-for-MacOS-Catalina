Samsung Universal Scan Driver for MacOS Catalina 10.15 (64 bit)

The most current driver of the HP Universal Scan Driver for MacOS for Samsung printers on https://support.hp.com/ is bugged, so it won't install on your system.

This repository _fixes those bug_, so you can (finally!) return to scan with your 64 bit MacOS.
